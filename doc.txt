Inter Event Durartion (IED) (time taken in closing of eyes and opening of eyes) = (EAR1-EAR2)/(no of frames) 

Percent Time with eyes almost closed (%TEC) = no of frames below open threshold / total no of frames -> will trigger alarm if >0.5

Blink Total Duration (BTD) = no of frames required for EAR to go reach complete opening from closed threshold will trigger alarm if frames>150 and opening still not reached. 

Long Closures (LC) = EAR contin. below closed threshold for > 60 frames


opening threshold = avg
closing threshold = avg/1.5
